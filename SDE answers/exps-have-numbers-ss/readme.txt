THE TASK

In this task modify SpreadSheet.java so that numbers can be directly
entered as expression operands in formulas, freely mixed with cell
references. For this task, a number is defined as a character string
that can be interpreted as a double value using Java's
Scanner::nextDouble() method WITH THE EXCEPTIONS that you may assume
  1. Operator characters (in particular "+" and "-") are not present, 
     so all numbers are non-negative, and there are no embedded 
     operators, as in 1.3e-6 and 2e+5.
  2. SignedNonNumbers such as NaN and Infinity are not present.
