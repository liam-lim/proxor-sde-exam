readme.txt -- for white-space-ss

THE TASK

In this task modify SpreadSheet.java so that blanks (spaces) can be
used around the operands and the operators in formulas. Any number of
blanks in any formula positions (except within operands) should be 
ignored.

Any blanks entered by the user should be retained and displayed.

Any nonblank characters should considered to be part of the formula.

A formula is denoted by an equal sign (=) as the first character.

Examples: "=A1" is a formula. " =A1" is not a formula because the first 
character is a blank.
